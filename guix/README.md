# Building Ouinet under a GNU/Guix environment

This assumes that you have a clone of Ouinet source at `/path/to/ouinet`.

To start the environment straight away:

    $ guix time-machine --channels=/path/to/ouinet/guix/channels.scm \
           -- environment -CN --pure \
              --manifest=/path/to/ouinet/guix/manifest.scm \
              --expose=/path/to/ouinet

If you instead want to keep the build profile as `$HOME/env/guix/ouinet/build`
for future invocations (e.g. to avoid its packages from being accidentally
garbage-collected), run:

    $ mkdir -p $HOME/env/guix/ouinet
    $ guix time-machine --channels=/path/to/ouinet/guix/channels.scm \
           -- package --profile=$HOME/env/guix/ouinet/build \
              --manifest=/path/to/ouinet/guix/manifest.scm

You need to do that whenever the `channels.scm` file changes.  Each time you
want to start the environment based on that profile, run:

    $ guix shell -CN --pure \
           --profile=$HOME/env/guix/ouinet/build \
           --expose=/path/to/ouinet

To build source inside of the environment:

    $ export TERM=vt100  # just for colorized warnings and errors
    $ time env SSL_CERT_FILE= GUIX_LOCPATH=$GUIX_ENVIRONMENT/lib/locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 \
           bash /path/to/ouinet/scripts/build-ouinet-local.sh

The build will fail because of Go's binary interpreter.  Run this command to
fix it, then rerun the command above:

    $ patchelf --set-interpreter \
               "$(patchelf --print-interpreter \
                           ouinet-local-build/CMakeFiles/*/CompilerIdCXX/a.out)" \
               ouinet-local-build/golang/bin/go

The build will be placed under `ouinet-local-build` at the current directory.
Please note that it will only be reusable for further builds as long as the
build environment remains unchanged (i.e. while both `channels.scm` and
`manifest.scm` stay the same).

When running the binaries outside of the container (recommended), remember to
set `SSL_CERT_FILE` like:

    $ env SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt \
          ouinet-local-build/PROGRAM ARGS...

Or you can just point the program's `tls-ca-cert-store-path` (e.g. as a
command-line option or in its configuration file) to the CA certificate bundle
file.  If you want to make sure that it uses no other CA certificates, you may
unset SSL variables like:

    $ env -u SSL_CERT_DIR -u SSL_CERT_FILE \
          ouinet-local-build/PROGRAM ARGS...
